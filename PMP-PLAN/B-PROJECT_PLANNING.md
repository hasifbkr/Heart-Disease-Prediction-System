# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is depicted and documented in the form of a Gantt Chart, which enables QTMT personnel to adhere to the rules and meet milestones on a regular basis. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work, such as the project manager, into many modules. Based on the WBS, each member has a role and a part in each step of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:


The system WBS for the Heart Disease Prediction System Project is shown below. This work breakdown structure is designed to divide the technical portion of the project into numerous modules, such as interface design, API administration, and Heart Disease Prediction:


### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is constructed to map out all of the essential activities and to design the process that will be maintained and authorised by the WBS.

The scope of this heart disease prediction study must be determined. For example, the project will gather and analyse data from a variety of sources, including electronic medical records, claims data, and data produced by patients. The project would create and train a prediction model utilising machine learning methods such as decision trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks, among others. Furthermore, this initiative would allow users to enter fresh data and make predictions regarding the risk of heart disease, with the findings shown visually. Last but not least, the project would have a user-friendly interface and would adhere to data privacy and security legislation and standards such as HIPAA to assure the data's safety and security.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? |What am I supposed to do about it? |
|-----|-----|-----|
|Cost <br> (Cost overruns, delays, and unanticipated charges all have an impact on the project's budget.)|1. Data acquisition costs: The costs associated with collecting and acquiring the data needed for the prediction model may be higher than expected. <br><br> 2. Unexpected costs for third-party services: The costs associated with using external services for data processing or model evaluation may be higher than expected. |1. Investigate alternative data sources that may be less expensive, or negotiate better prices with current data providers. <br><br> 2. To mitigate the risk of unexpected costs for third-party services, the project team could create detailed cost estimates for these services and set aside a budget contingency.|
|Quality <br> (Changes in project requirements, insufficient training for team members, and a lack of test or validation are all examples of quality hazards.)|1. Lack of data quality: The quality of the data used to train the prediction model may be poor, which could negatively impact the performance of the model. <br><br> 2. Security and privacy issues: There could be issues with data security and privacy, which could lead to loss of data or privacy breaches.|1. To mitigate the risk of lack of data quality, the project team could review the data collection and cleaning process, or perform more thorough data quality checks to ensure that the data is accurate and complete. <br><br> 2. To mitigate the risk of security and privacy issues, the project team could invest in security and privacy infrastructure, or work with legal or privacy experts to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.|
|Time <br> (Delays, missed deadlines, or longer durations can all have an impact on the project's timeline.) | 1. Data collection delays: The collection and acquisition of data for the prediction model may take longer than expected, which could delay the development of the model. <br><br> 2. System implementation delays: The implementation and deployment of the system may take longer than expected. |1. To reduce the possibility of data collection delays, the project team might plan for appropriate data gathering time and have backup data sources available if necessary. <br><br> 2. To minimize the likelihood of system implementation delays, the project team should devote more resources to the implementation phase or divide the implementation into smaller, more manageable parts.|
