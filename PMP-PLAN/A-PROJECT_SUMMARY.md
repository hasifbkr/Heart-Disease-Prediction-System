# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in today's society. Identification of cardiovascular illness is a critical but difficult process that must be conducted meticulously and effectively, and proper automation would be ideal. Every human being, even physicians, cannot be equally skilled. All doctors cannot be equally proficient in every sub-specialty, and in many regions, skilled and specialist doctors are difficult to find. An automated approach for medical diagnostics might improve medical treatment while simultaneously lowering expenses.

In this study, we created a system that can efficiently find rules **to predict the risk level of patients based on a particular health metric**. The rules can be prioritised based on the needs of the user. The system's performance is tested in terms of classification accuracy, and the findings reveal that the system has significant promise in forecasting the risk level of heart disease more precisely.
