# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in today's society. Identification of cardiovascular illness is a critical but difficult process that must be conducted meticulously and effectively, and proper automation would be ideal. Every human being, even physicians, cannot be equally skilled. All doctors cannot be equally proficient in every sub-specialty, and in many regions, skilled and specialist doctors are difficult to find. An automated approach for medical diagnostics might improve medical treatment while simultaneously lowering expenses.
