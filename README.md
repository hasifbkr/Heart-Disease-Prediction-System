# Heart Disease Prediction System

This is a project that predicts cardiac disease based on the patient's data. Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are two Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques used in this research (CNN).

The project is created using a Project Management Plan (PMP) to better manage the project's lifespan. To manage the project, many charting approaches such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are employed.

The PMP-Plan created is just a collaborative simulation between third-party organisations.
