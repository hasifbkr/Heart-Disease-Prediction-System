# Heart Disease Prediction System

This is a project that predicts cardiac disease based on the patient's data. Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are two Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques used in this research (CNN).

The project is created using a Project Management Plan (PMP) to better manage the project's lifespan. To manage the project, many charting approaches such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) are employed.

The PMP-Plan created is just a collaborative simulation between third-party organisations.

## Project Plan Management

## Project Management Plan
##### Project Summary: [Project Summary](PMP-PLAN/A-PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
Project Summary give a brief overview of the project objectives and team members details. 

##### Project Planning: [Project Planning](PMP-PLAN/B-PROJECT_PLANNING.md)
Planning processes include developing and implementing a feasible strategy to guarantee that the project meets the needs of the company. This phase includes the creation of a Gantt chart and a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

##### Project Implementation: [Project Implementaion](PMP-PLAN/C-PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
Project implementation specifies the project deliverables, such as software requirements and intelligent system design.

##### Project Execution: [Project Execution](PMP-PLAN/D-PROJECT_EXECUTION.md)
Project execution phase is where the outcome, coding blocks, and technological implementation are specified and documented.

##### Project Closing: [Project Closing](PMP-PLAN/E-PROJECT_CLOSING.md)
Project Closing denotes the conclusion of the project lifetime, at which point the project must record the closing document and the lesson learned report.

##### Project Presentation: [Project Presentation](PMP-PLAN/F-PROJECT_PRESENTATION.md)
Project presentation presents a demonstration of QTMT INC's heart disease prediction system.
